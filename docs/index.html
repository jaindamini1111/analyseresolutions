	<br>
	<p class="abst"><i>AnalyseResolutions v1.2</i> is a highly tailored tool (read: a PhDWare code-sketch) designed to access the digital facsimile of a single document, the <i>Resolutions of the States General</i> for the year 1740, to interpret select features of the document's layout and the visual marks of the textual content, and to use that information to generate a structured full-text XML document.</p>
	<p class="abst">The tailored application of image analysis is based on heuristic rules derived from modelling and simple document image analysis and understanding concepts and methods. The text is recognised with the <i>Tesseract v3.05</i> OCR engine.</p>
	<p class="abst">This tool will not work for you out-of-the-box—no, not even for <i>you</i>.</p>
	
	<p class="h2">Preliminaries</p>
	<p class="para">The work discussed here was part of a case study within Tuomo Toljamo's PhD research (2014–) at King's College London. The research explores the impact of digital facsimiles on digital scholarly editing, and focusses especially on their computational affordances. The work on the case study was started during a research secondment at the Huygens ING (KNAW) and relates closely to other work ongoing at the institution.</p>
	<p class="para">The research leading to these results has received funding from the People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007–2013/ under REA grant agreement nº 317436.</p> 
	
	<p class="h2">Introduction</p>
	<p class="para">The <i>AnalyseResolutions v1.2</i> tool and the other resources which will be made available here were developed during a PhD case study. The case study was closely related to a series of pilot projects initiated at the Huygens ING to explore methods alternative to traditional editing for the digital opening of a vast archival series, the <i>Resolutions of the States General 1576–1796</i> (see Sluijter et al. 2016). The series is of considerable interest to historians, but its sheer breadth—the series spans unbroken for over two-hundred years and runs up to some 200,000 pages—has posed challenges to its comprehensive manual editing.</p>
	
	<p class="para">While historians are keen to access the information in the series' textual content, the documents of the series themselves are highly structured and their layout arrangement is also a carrier of information. The specific aims of this case study were to explore whether and how the visual information (e.g. information encoded in layout details) captured in the cover-to-cover images of these documents could be usefully harnessed for the digital opening of the series. The means selected for this exploration was tool development.</p>
	
	<p class="para">Towards these purposes, the case study focussed on a single document, the printed <i>Resolutions</i> for the year 1740, and borrowed the conceptual and methodological toolbox from the field of document image analysis and understanding. The development work itself was document-centric and based on an extensive modelling of the 1740 document's systems of structuring. </p>

	<p class="para">As a product of PhDWare, the tools, resources and documentation made available here are done so as a means of communication in the hope that it will be useful for someone and as a thank you for all the resources that in turn made this work all the much easier; at the same time, however, please understand that (1) no support is promised, but some may be offered; and (2) the code itself is a thicket in need of tending.</p>
